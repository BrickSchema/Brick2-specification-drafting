Possible deprecations, due to unclear definitions/quantity kinds/and use cases:
- waste amount sensor (clarify as fill level sensor)
- warm/cool temperature adjust sensor
- DC bus voltage sensor
- RENAME "peak demand sensor" to "peak electricity demand sensor"?
- air flow demand setpoint -> air flow setpoint
	- explain how this is different! Else we will deprecate
- box mode command (what is this? could not find a definition)
- bypass command
	- too much variation in the definition (is it a ratio of face/bypass damper positions? position of just the bypass damper?)
	- need guidance on how modeling face/bypass damper system points can be improved
- brick:Close_Limit (says it limits the values of a close setpoint, but there is no close setpoint)
