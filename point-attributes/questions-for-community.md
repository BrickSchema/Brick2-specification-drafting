Questions to Brick community + consortium:
- how to model quantity/substance of radiant panel temperature sensors
	- is substance "concrete"?
	- how to break out the "measurement location", i.e. core, outside surface face, inside surface face
- PID loop points. How do we want to model these?
	- ask Brick OR 231P folks
	- acceleration time setpoint
- introducing "abstract classes" whic hgroup, but cannot be instantiated
	- `brick:Air_Quality_Sensor`
	- `brick:Boiler_Command`
		- these don't have any meaning on their own. Could be an enable_cmd, run_cmd, etc
		- if abstract, then add boiler_enable_cmd, boiler_run_cmd
	- *if there are no other examples, then maybe we either deprecate air quality sensor, or we find another way to define it. It is a useful umbrella term for many sensor classes*
- Alarm parameters; how to model?
    - `brick:Alarm_Delay_Parameter`
    - `brick:Alarm_Sensitivity_Parameter`
- EnumerationKinds for commands to capture specific annotations:
    - `brick:Automatic_Mode_Command`
    - `brick:hasEnum? s223:EnumerationKind-Binary -> brick:EnumerationKind-AutomaticMode = {brick:Automatic-Mode-True, brick:Automatic-Mode-False}`
- how to break "cooling" and "heating" out into annotations on classes:
	- are they a process? system? equipment? what's the relationship between "brick:Average_Cooling_Demand_Sensor" and Cooling?
- do we need a "thermal demand" to capture cooling/heating demand as a subtype of power?
	- cooling demand (subtype of power)
		- "power required to meet the cooling needs"?
	- heating demand (subtype of energy)
- CO2 Alarm and related Alarms:
	- do we need more specific subclasses? Or is it always clear what a CO2 Alarm is?
- Alarms:
    - always boolean/3-valued? Need to model the different "statuses" of alarms? how do these relate to enum kinds for statuses
